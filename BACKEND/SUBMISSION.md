## Run Instructions

Install Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. Use the command "npm run start" to run the program.

## Additional Information

Working with NodeJS, MongoDB, Express and programming in Javascript was all new so the shortening URLs and storing to a database is functional. 
I did not fix the Jest tests or shortened URL being converted back to the original URL.
